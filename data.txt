Core power time‑series + faults
Use these for:
	•	electrical_measurements (currents, voltages, frequency, power, energy)
	•	meta IDs
	•	fault / event labels and windows

Smart‑grid operational / asset monitoring
These give you realistic smart‑grid “asset-level” data you can map to breaker_id, feeder_id, panel_id, etc.

Breaker‑like fault and event behavior
Use these to define labels such as operating_state_label, fault_type_label, nuisance_trip_flag, etc.

How to use them against your schema
	•	Map PSML / PMU / smart‑grid CSV fields to your sensor_data (phase currents, voltages, frequency, power, power_factor/“stability”) and meta IDs.
	•	Use event/fault labels and timestamps from the PMU and fault‑classification datasets to build event_and_trip_logs, condition_labels, and outcome_labels (e.g., “fault within 7 days”).
	•	Use Smart Grid Asset Monitoring fields for breaker_id / feeder_id / panel_id style identifiers and basic health_state_label proxies.
